# Jupiter Notebook - python - adding data

This Jupyter Notebook processes a dataset of points of interest (POIs) by enriching it with corresponding city and district information. The main functionality of the notebook includes:

>>Loading geographic data (GeoJSON or shapefiles) representing city and district boundaries.
>>Assigning each POI a matching city and district based on its geographic coordinates using spatial joins.
>>Cleaning and exporting the enhanced POI dataset for further analysis or visualization.

This process is useful in urban data analytics, GIS applications, or any project that requires contextual geographic labeling of point-based data.
